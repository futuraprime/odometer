# Universal Odometer

## Around the Earth

    circumference_at_equator = 40,075 km => 40,075 km
    
We want this is m/s, so...
    
    equator_speed = circumference_at_equator / 24 hr => 1,669.7917 km/hr
    equator_speed in m/s => 463.831 m/s
    equator_speed in mph => 1,037.5604 mph
    
 
## Relative to the Sun
    
    distance from earth to the sun = 94.5e6 mi #googled
    orbit_radius = distance from earth to the sun in km => 152,083,008 km
    orbit_circumference = orbit_radius * 2 * pi => 955,565,721.3373 km
    orbit_duration = (365 days in seconds) + (6 hr in seconds) + 7 seconds => 31,557,607 seconds
    orbit_speed = orbit_circumference / orbit_duration => 30.28 km/seconds
    orbit_speed in mph => 67,734.5288 mph
    
    
    
## Relative to Galactic Center

    1 parsec in ly => 3.2616 ly
    distance_to_center = 8.2 kpc in km => 2.5303e17 km
    1 myr = 1,000,000 yr
    galactic orbit circumference = distance_to_center * 2 * pi => 1.5898e18 km
    galactic_orbit_duration = 225 myr => 225,000,000 yr
    galactic orbit speed = galactic orbit circumference / galactic_orbit_duration => 7,065,807,175.0566 km/yr
    galactic orbit speed in km/hour => 806,063.4573 km/hour
    galactic orbit speed in km/s => 223.9065 km/s
    galactic orbit speed in mph => 500,864.6115 mph
    
    
## Relative to Background Radiation

According to the Astronomical Society of the Pacific:

    2.1*10^6 km/hr in km/s => 583.3333 km/s
    
According to the Scientific American article:
    
    390 km/s => 390 km/s
    390 km/s in mph => 872,405.1539 mph
